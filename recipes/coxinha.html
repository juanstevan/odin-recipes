		<p>Coxinha is a popular Brazilian snack made from shredded chicken filling encased in a soft, savory dough, shaped like a teardrop or drumstick, then breaded and deep-fried until golden and crispy. The name "coxinha" means "little thigh," as its shape resembles a chicken drumstick. It is commonly served as a street food or party appetizer throughout Brazil.</p>
